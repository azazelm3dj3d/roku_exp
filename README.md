# Roku Experiments ("ROKU_EXP_vX_00X")
This "application" is mainly smaller functions to manipulate a Roku TV in whatever way I want. This doesn't currently do a whole lot, but as I think of things to test, I'll include them in the script. This all started when I realized the Roku TV actually has multiple open ports on the local network, so it seemed like a fun little project to play around with.

## How to Build
You can generate your own package to upload by running the following script:

```bash
./generate.sh
```

If you do plan on using this, I'd recommend getting familiar with the [Roku developer documentation](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/overview). With this app being so minimal at the moment, I guess you could use it as a starting point if you want.
